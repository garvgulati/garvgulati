# Hey there, I'm Garv 👋

## What I am Currently Doing

I'm currently diving deep into machine learning models and how they transform the way we analyze and interpret data. This project is part of my learning journey, where I experiment with:

**2+** years diving deep into data

Sentiment analysis to gauge market sentiment

Data correlation between news and stock movements

Automated insights using ML techniques

As AI and ML continue to evolve, understanding their impact on data-driven decision-making is crucial. I'm excited to explore how these models can uncover hidden patterns and improve predictive analytics.

### 🔍 What I'm Learning

✔ NLP & Sentiment Analysis – Extracting meaning from text

✔ Time Series Forecasting – Predicting trends from historical data

✔ Feature Engineering – Enhancing model accuracy

✔ Model Interpretability – Making ML insights explainable


### 🤖 Future Goals

Implement deep learning models (LSTMs, Transformers) for better predictions

Explore reinforcement learning in trading strategies

Build automated dashboards for real-time sentiment tracking
