# Hey there, I'm Garv 👋

## What I am Currently Doing

I'm currently diving deep into machine learning models and how they transform the way we analyze and interpret data. This project is part of my learning journey, where I experiment with:

- **2+** years diving deep into data

Sentiment analysis to gauge market sentiment

Data correlation between news and stock movements

Automated insights using ML techniques

As AI and ML continue to evolve, understanding their impact on data-driven decision-making is crucial. I'm excited to explore how these models can uncover hidden patterns and improve predictive analytics.

### 🔍 What I'm Learning

✔ NLP & Sentiment Analysis – Extracting meaning from text

✔ Time Series Forecasting – Predicting trends from historical data

✔ Feature Engineering – Enhancing model accuracy

✔ Model Interpretability – Making ML insights explainable


### 🤖 Future Goals

Implement deep learning models (LSTMs, Transformers) for better predictions

Explore reinforcement learning in trading strategies

Build automated dashboards for real-time sentiment tracking

## What I Recently Did 🔧

### 🚴 **Cyclistic Data Analysis**
*Making sense of bike-sharing chaos*

Picture this: Raw data from a bike-sharing company, thousands of rides, and one mission — find the patterns that matter.

What I discovered:
- Key user behavior trends
- Strategic recommendations for engagement
- Insights that actually move the needle
- Data storytelling that stakeholders understand

**The result:** Turned spreadsheet chaos into strategic gold.

### 🛣️ **Route Delivery Optimization**
*Because efficiency is everything*

Built an AI-powered system that doesn't just find routes — it finds the *best* routes.

The magic:
- Multiple algorithm comparison
- Real-time path cost calculation
- Visual route display
- Lowest-cost path selection

**The vibe:** Making delivery logistics look effortless (spoiler: it's not, but AI makes it seem that way).

I believe every dataset has a story to tell. My job? I'm the translator between data and humans. Sometimes the data speaks in whispers, sometimes it shouts — either way, I'm listening.
