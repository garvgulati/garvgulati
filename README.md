# Hey there, I'm Garv 👋

## What I am Currently Doing

I'm currently diving deep into machine learning models and how they transform the way we analyze and interpret data. This project is part of my learning journey, where I experiment with:

Sentiment analysis to gauge market sentiment

Data correlation between news and stock movements

Automated insights using ML techniques

As AI and ML continue to evolve, understanding their impact on data-driven decision-making is crucial. I'm excited to explore how these models can uncover hidden patterns and improve predictive analytics.

### 🔍 What I'm Learning

✔ NLP & Sentiment Analysis – Extracting meaning from text

✔ Time Series Forecasting – Predicting trends from historical data

✔ Feature Engineering – Enhancing model accuracy

✔ Model Interpretability – Making ML insights explainable


### 🤖 Future Goals

Implement deep learning models (LSTMs, Transformers) for better predictions

Explore reinforcement learning in trading strategies

Build automated dashboards for real-time sentiment tracking

## What I Recently Did 🔧

### 🚴 **Cyclistic Data Analysis**
*Making sense of bike-sharing chaos*

Picture this: Raw data from a bike-sharing company, thousands of rides, and one mission — find the patterns that matter.

What I discovered:
- Key user behavior trends
- Strategic recommendations for engagement
- Insights that actually move the needle
- Data storytelling that stakeholders understand

**The result:** Turned spreadsheet chaos into strategic gold.

### 🛣️ **Route Delivery Optimization**
*Because efficiency is everything*

Built an AI-powered system that doesn't just find routes — it finds the *best* routes.

The magic:
- Multiple algorithm comparison
- Real-time path cost calculation
- Visual route display
- Lowest-cost path selection

**The vibe:** Making delivery logistics look effortless (spoiler: it's not, but AI makes it seem that way).

I believe every dataset has a story to tell. My job? I'm the translator between data and humans. Sometimes the data speaks in whispers, sometimes it shouts — either way, I'm listening.
