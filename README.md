# Hey there, I'm Garv 👋

**(yes, another developer who thinks data tells stories)**

I turn raw data into actionable insights — and somehow make algorithms look elegant.

**Currently:** Building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems.  
**Previously:** Optimizing delivery routes and analyzing bike-sharing patterns.  
**Always:** Caffeinated and curious about the next dataset.

## The Journey So Far 🚀

From crunching numbers to crafting AI solutions, I've been on a mission to bridge the gap between complex data and practical solutions.

**Plot twist:** The messiest datasets often hide the most beautiful insights ⚡

## What I'm Building 🔧

### 🚴 **Cyclistic Data Analysis**
*Making sense of bike-sharing chaos*

Picture this: Raw data from a bike-sharing company, thousands of rides, and one mission — find the patterns that matter.

What I discovered:
- Key user behavior trends
- Strategic recommendations for engagement
- Insights that actually move the needle
- Data storytelling that stakeholders understand

**The result:** Turned spreadsheet chaos into strategic gold.

### 🛣️ **Route Delivery Optimization**
*Because efficiency is everything*

Built an AI-powered system that doesn't just find routes — it finds the *best* routes.

The magic:
- Multiple algorithm comparison
- Real-time path cost calculation
- Visual route display
- Lowest-cost path selection

**The vibe:** Making delivery logistics look effortless (spoiler: it's not, but AI makes it seem that way).

### Fun Fact 🎲
I believe every dataset has a story to tell. My job? I'm the translator between data and humans. Sometimes the data speaks in whispers, sometimes it shouts — either way, I'm listening.
